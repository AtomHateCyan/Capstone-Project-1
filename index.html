    <p>In coclusion, I have learned a lot about Web Development especially HTML Courses. 
        Although, i like Angela how she explains and it is very easy and useful to understand. 
        I learned lots of new things, for example how to host a Website or how to sort files more easily in HTML.
    Thanks a lot. </p>
